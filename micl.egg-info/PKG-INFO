Multiple-instance contrastive learning for weakly-supervised visual grounding in chest X-rays

## Installation
Make sure that you have installed [torch](https://pytorch.org/) compatible with your CUDA version.

Then install our repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mishgon/micl.git && cd micl && pip install -e .
```

If you encounter any issues with opencv, try
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python && pip install opencv-python-headless
```
